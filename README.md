# What is this

This is the repository for a 3D game about [linear logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_logic)
I am currently planning.

With regard to the lack of a better name, this project is temporarily being named PuzzleWarp.
This name might change in the future.

Possible alternative names:
- SHAP-U: Shapes, Holes And Parallel-Universes

The design for the game is described at [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

As it stands, the software is currently not properly licensed, as there will probably
be assets in the game which originate
from multiple sources.
